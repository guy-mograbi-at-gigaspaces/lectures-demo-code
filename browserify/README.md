- Why/When should I use it
- Travis Client example
    - Show code that hopefully will run on frontend and backend
    - Show the gruntfile that follows it
    - Show wrappers for angular, jquery and vanilla javascript
    - Run examples for all
- Add tests - the tests should run on nodejs and frontend too!
